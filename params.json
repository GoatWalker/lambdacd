{"name":"LambdaCD","tagline":"a library to define a continuous delivery pipeline in code","body":"# LambdaCD\r\n\r\n* it's a continuous delivery pipeline, in code\r\n* it's Jenkins/Go/TeamCity/..., in clojure\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flosell/lambdacd.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/flosell/lambdacd)\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\nThis project is still in it's early prototype/proof of concept/experimentation stage, so don't rely on everything working flawlessly. There will be bugs, there will be missing features, things will change and things will look ugly.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, give it a try, send in bug reports, feature requests or just give feedback!\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n* `lein new lambdacd <NAME>` will create a new pipeline-project\r\n* `lein ring server` from the project folder starts the server and opens the the UI for your pipeline\r\n* your pipeline is defined in `src/<NAME>/`. Have a look around, change some steps or add some steps on your own.\r\n* for details, check out the [walkthrough](doc/walkthrough.md), learn more about the [design](doc/design.md) or just dive straight into the [sample code](src/todopipeline)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\n* `lein test :all` runs all tests\r\n* if you want to run the example-pipeline contained in the code, you first need to setup a mock-deployment environment on your machine (two VMs where we deploy a TodoMVC client and server):\r\n  * install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)\r\n  * have github-access set up (you need to be able to clone with ssh)\r\n  * `./go setup` starts up two VMs in vagrant where we deploy to and exports the ssh-config for them so that it can be used by the deployment scripts\r\n  * `lein ring server` starts a server and opens pipeline-view showing the example-pipeline in your browser.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\n* TODO\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright Â© 2014 Florian Sellmayr\r\n\r\nDistributed under the Apache License 2.0\r\n","google":"UA-55996730-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
