# LambdaCD

* it's a continuous delivery pipeline, in code
* it's your own custom built Jenkins/Go/TeamCity/..., in clojure

## Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flosell/lambdacd.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/flosell/lambdacd)

This project is still in it's early prototype/proof of concept/experimentation stage, so don't rely on everything working flawlessly. There will be bugs, there will be missing features, things will change and things will look ugly.

Nevertheless, give it a try, send in bug reports, feature requests or just give feedback!

## Usage

* `lein new lambdacd <NAME>` will create a new pipeline-project
* `lein ring server` from the project folder starts the server and opens the the UI for your pipeline
* your pipeline is defined in `src/<NAME>/`. Have a look around, change some steps or add some steps on your own.


## Example

```clojure
;; buildsteps
(def some-repo "git@github.com:flosell/somerepo")

(defn wait-for-repo [_ ctx]
  (git/wait-for-git ctx some-repo "master"))

(defn ^{:display-type :container} with-repo [& steps]
  (git/with-git some-repo steps))

(defn run-tests [{cwd :cwd} ctx]
  (shell/bash ctx cwd
    "lein test"))

(defn compile-and-deploy [{cwd :cwd} ctx]
  (shell/bash ctx cwd
    "./buildscripts/compile-and-deploy.sh"))

;; the pipeline
(def pipeline
  `(
     (either
       wait-for-manual-trigger
       wait-for-repo)
     (with-repo
       run-tests
       compile-and-deploy)
   ))

```

* Detailed Tutorial: [doc/walkthrough.md](doc/walkthrough.md)
* A complete LambdaCD infrastructure in code: https://github.com/flosell/devops-101-lambdacd
* Documented Sample-Code: http://flosell.github.io/lambdacd/marginalia/uberdoc.html


## Development

* `./go` is your starting point. Run it without arguments to see all the options, e.g.:
  * `./go testall` runs all tests
  * `./go serve` starts a server and opens pipeline-view showing the example-pipeline in your browser.
* if you want to run the example-pipeline contained in the code successfully, you first need to setup a mock-deployment environment on your machine (two VMs where we deploy a TodoMVC client and server):
  * install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
  * have github-access set up (you need to be able to clone with ssh)
  * `./go setup` starts up two VMs in vagrant where we deploy to and exports the ssh-config for them so that it can be used by the deployment scripts


## Contribute

* File bug reports, give feedback
* Send Pull Requests, or if you are missing features (support for a different version control system, nicer syntactic sugar, ...) consider creating an extension library.
