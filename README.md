# LambdaCD

* it's a continuous delivery pipeline, in code
* it's Jenkins/Go/TeamCity/..., in clojure

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flosell/lambdacd.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/flosell/lambdacd)

## Status

This project is still in it's early prototype/proof of concept/experimentation stage, so don't rely on everything working flawlessly. There will be bugs, there will be missing features, things will change and things will look ugly.

Nevertheless, give it a try, send in bug reports, feature requests or just give feedback!

## Usage

* `lein new lambdacd <NAME>` will create a new pipeline-project 
* `lein ring server` from the projects folder starts the server and opens the the UI for your pipeline
* your pipeline is defined in `src/<NAME>/`. Have a look around, change some steps or add some steps on your own

* TODO: add more info here

## Design

LambdaCD is designed to be a library that provides you with the essential building-blocks to develop a small application that is your build-pipeline. You would then deploy this application like you would deploy any other application or piece of build-infrastructure.

In this world, a build pipeline is just a sequence of clojure-functions (the build-steps) that implement a certain convention, i.e. they receive a map of parameters and return a map of output-values. We use this design for everything in the pipeline:
* triggers are build-steps that wait for something (e.g. a new git-commit) before returning
* containers are build-steps that coordinate a set of child-steps and control their execution (e.g. to execute a set of steps in parallel)

TODO: go on here?


## Development

* `lein test` runs all tests
* if you want to run the example-pipeline contained in the code, you first need to setup a mock-deployment environment on your machine (two VMs where we deploy a TodoMVC client and server):
  * install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
  * have github-access set up (you need to be able to clone with ssh)
  * `./go setup` starts up two VMs in vagrant where we deploy to and exports the ssh-config for them so that it can be used by the deployment scripts
  * `lein ring server` starts a server and opens pipeline-view showing the example-pipeline in your browser.
